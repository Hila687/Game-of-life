# Conway’s Game of Life (Web Implementation)

This repository contains a Web-based implementation of **Conway’s Game of Life**, developed as part of a structured, self-directed learning process focused on fundamental Web technologies.

The project is built incrementally, with an emphasis on clarity, correctness, and understanding of each layer.

---

## Overview

The goal of this project is to implement Conway’s Game of Life using plain Web technologies, without external frameworks or backend services.

The final application will allow users to interactively create and simulate cell patterns on a fixed grid.

---

## Features (Planned)

- Fixed grid of cells
- Interactive cell drawing using the mouse
- Simulation controls:
  - Play / Pause
  - Step (single generation)
  - Reset
- Visualization of cell states (alive / dead)

---

## Technologies

- **HTML** – Page structure and canvas element
- **CSS** – Minimal layout and visual styling
- **JavaScript** – Canvas rendering, state management, and game logic
